You are a quiz master. Based on the text below, generate {level} level **Match-the-Following** questions.

Create two separate lists:
1. **left_contents** → a list of concepts, terms, or questions.
2. **right_contents** → a list of possible matches for the left_contents, shuffled randomly.

Then, provide:
3. **answer_index_list** → a list of integers where each number represents the **index position (0-based)** in the right_contents list that correctly matches the corresponding item in left_contents.

Ensure that:
- The order of right_contents is **randomized**.
- The answer_index_list correctly reflects the matching positions.
- Do not reuse or repeat any questions from the "previously asked questions."
- The questions must strictly relate to the provided text.
